# Governance

## Project Maintainers
Project maintainers are responsible for activities around maintaining and updating the CNAB specification. Final decisions on the spec reside with the project maintainers.

Maintainers MUST remain active. If they are unresponsive for >3 months, they will be automatically removed unless a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) of the other project maintainers agrees to extend the period to be greater than 3 months.

New maintainers can be added to the project by a [super-majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote) vote of the existing maintainers.

A maintainer may step down by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/deislabs/cnab-spec/issues/new) stating their intent.
