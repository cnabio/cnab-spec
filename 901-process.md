# Appendix A: Preliminary Release Process

While CNAB has not officially been assigned to a standards body, it is good practice to put in place a provisional process for indicating the status, stability, and reliability of the specification.

## Versioning

Specifications shall each track their own versions, where a version is [semantically versioned](https://semver.org).

The CNAB Core specification shall therefore be formally referenced as _Cloud Native Application Bundle Core 1.0.0_. The phase of the process MAY be appended as a stability marker: _Cloud Native Application Bundle Core 1.0.0-WD_. It MAY be abbreviated to _CNAB1_.

## Process

The provisional process is outlined here, and is derived from the [W3C Process](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/)

The specification will proceed through the following phases:

- *Working Draft (WD)*: During this phase, the specification is open for review. During this phase, major (breaking) changes may be made.
- *Candidate Recommendation (CR)*: This phase indicates that a final review is immanent. During this phase, minor (non-breaking) changes may be made, and major changes will be considered if they present an immanent problem with the specification.
- *Recommendation (REC)*: This phase indicates that the specification is stable, and the present version is no longer open for changes to the conformance of the specification
    - W3C [class 1 and 2 changes](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#correction-classes) are allowed on a recommendation.
    - W3C class 3 and 4 changes can be addressed in a _minor version update_.

And [errata section](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/#rec-modify) may be added to a specification as an appendix, as a location for tracking clarifications and changes.
