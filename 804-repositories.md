# CNAB Repositories

This section is non-normative, but is here to articulate the design envisioned for CNAB.

A CNAB repository is a location where packaged bundles can be stored and shared. They can be created by anyone to distribute their own bundles.

CNAB bundles can be stored in [OCI Distribution-compliant repository](https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md)

_This section is under active discussion and design_
